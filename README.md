- despite i am lacking time even for some simple things like administration work that i must to perform right now when i have completed with uploading files for my 'Audacity-2-4-2-AR' repository i am creating this new repository because ...well, 'She is the time now!'
- a little step astray --that urgent critical admin work --i want to substitute xfce for plasma DE in my production machine because --you know --it is usable and beautiful;
  - i am going to perform a reinstall from Artix stable iso
    - [published in June 2022, she is Sunday, February 5th, 2023 now; not sure if i should expect a breakage with graphical iso, i have already performed it for my older first machine who gets overheated during my long working sessions and so is used mainly for 'Mypaint' & 'Thunderbird'];
  - say i do not like to clean up after messy software and currently linux cannot do that for me
    - [yet i am designing a bash script for removing artifacts created by discarded software pieces].
- the encounter that chilled me up on creating this new repository even though i was a kinda shy of making this knowledge publy available was my recent watching youtube creators who have triggered a sense of uniqueness in me.

- ##### mentioning 'creators' i for certain do not mean people producing trash spamming youtube to stylelessness. no i do not have a respect for people like that guy posting on linux and FOSS matters that i have just run away from.
<img align="right" width="33%" alt="Sexy-Nicki-Minaj-topless-selfies-4" title="casual wear --anything considerd inappropriate for more formal occasions" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/216850274-adf0d5a0-5ed3-449e-9aca-18fb6818f9c2.jpg">

- that guy slams linux and open source model under a hood of being linux enthusiast and FOSS extremist --he is derogary about 'protest distros' as he calls us [Artix] and fixed-release distro called Devuan. he says that we are 'systemd haters' and he embraces systemd himself explicitly telling he is 'against protest distros', repeating again and again that 'there is nothing special about "Ardex" [sic] --there are hundreds of Arch-based distros around and ONLY TWO DO DESERVE AN ATTENTION --Arco and Manjaro'; it is clearly seen from those videos:
  - distrotube 
    - ['"Hey, DT. Why Arco Linux Instead Of Arch?"'](https://youtu.be/eFEqMpLgr1k)
    - ['Top Five Arch-Based Linux Distros 2022'](https://youtu.be/zkmTpxVpj6Q)
- but his real intentions are made clear to us today --in those years-old videos he was posing an Arch linux adept, an archer, --now he is rising up against Arch AND Judd Vinet; you may check this:
  - ['Arch Linux Updates Keep Breaking Packages (I've Given Up On Pacman!) **[Nov 24, 2022]**'](https://youtu.be/tgbpNuOfFQM) [bullshit, i was using GIMP during this period ...your hand?]
    - what would be next? Ubuntu? pure Debian? i do not think so ...he touts ENTIRELY DIFFERENT concepts --Donald Trump, 'a democrat President' [sic], & 4chan 'funny folks' [just look into his face when he is telling '4chan', do not want to return to his videos though] --pushing them against Mozilla and other ones opting for safer internet where 'white supremacist President' would not be able to instigate riots by calling for 'the righteous ones to go homes to their riffles and training sessions'.
- other stuff:
  - ['YouTube's Unfair Treatment Pushes Creators To Leave For Odysee'](https://youtu.be/VHsHMWW7qkU)
  - ['Why Is There No Software For Linux!!!'](https://youtu.be/JLTErwGqP44)
    - that ultimately wraps up to him falling a victim of his own point drawn in
      - ['I Will Not Watch These Linux YouTubers'](https://youtu.be/8KzV5NE0dOU)
      - and resolutes to tell-telling choosing of the title
        - ['Quit Installing Arch on Family and Friend's Computers'](https://youtu.be/gg-V_Eevx30) **[Mar 16, 2018]**

- ##### no ...are other people ...not white supremacists
- today i has watched a video from Jeffrey Kaplan ['Russell's Paradox - a simple explanation of a profound problem'](https://youtu.be/ymGt7I4Yn3k)
- and i switched to it from a video by Dialect ['Logic at its Limit: The Grelling-Nelson Paradox'](https://youtu.be/U2l-Ty5yyU4)
- and watching Jeffrey's lesson i have realised something chill --my native language and by Sapir-Worf hypothesis our mentality are totally unique --we do not fall victims of Russell's paradox!
- i originate from Karhide, Gethen; this land is an analogue of Africa. actually all densely populated areas of Gethen are tropical latitudes, but Karhide is an origin of gethenian civilization [yes, i am an afrocentrist!].
- our difference from human species in that we are ambivalent. if you do not realise how huge the gap between the species is --consider that we are completely incompatible genetically --no offspring could be conceived by a terranian and a gethenian. Sic.

- ##### github special repo
- in my home world's github we do not have a concept of 'One-And-Only Special Repository' --our github allows us to maintain up to three special repositories on a profile page!
- so i would be happy having this new repository as an another 'special repository' shown next to my personal details` repository on my profile page ...but you already see.
- it is REALLY IMPORTANT ONE for me --it is dedicated to my native language.
  - you may envision it as 'wiktionary for karhidish'; actually was going to make a pdf dictionary but ...it has some downsides to it --github is not really good for pdf documentation.
  - so accounting for my unfamiliarity with creation of wikis you would may expect a kinda dh.wiktionary.org from me in the nearest term; it is described as 'the most distant descendant of Proto-Indo-European language you could ever imagine'.
    - i would not go into deeper details for now [5th 0f February, 2023]

### Russell's paradox defeated
- i agree --it is an unsurmountable obstacle for bi-valent logic --'{x : x is a set that does not contain itself}' or 'is not true of itself' --where it do result in killing solution of '"if it does then it does not" and "if it does not then it does"'
- and my biological species has ambivalent logic. Sic.
  - it affects everything in our existence:
    - we change our gender role accordingly to our partner's taking of a gender role during the reproductive cycle
    - we exercise in BOTH binary and ternary ['fuzzy'] logics
    - we are capable to visualise a decision tree in an entire from a first mental iteration of it
    - we are capable to dynamically visualise an evolution of such fully visualised decision tree on next mental iteration
    - we have a foretelling practise --i mean exactly that --we are capable of predicting a future
    - <ins>we can make love in a trio</ins>
  - my native language do not possess some features are default to typical human languages:
    - karhidish does not have diminutive (but other languages of Gethen do have a diminutive);
    - there are no semantics for 'belonginess' in karhidish language so there are no derivational suffixes standing for 'adherence' or 'follower' [certainly a possessive case do exist];
    - neither of languages of Gethen have an augumentative --it is not natural for gethenians to express a quality of an object in such short-going (mean revealing) manner;
    - and one more note in a spirit of Sapir-Worf hypothesis --'it is possible to enter artificial kemmer or even change or select its phase or valence using certain drugs --such behavior is called "a pervertion" by ambivalent gethenians; whereas humans say "a gay" noting sexually misbehaving people ambivalent men say "a pervert" meaning deliberate selection of the valence while parthenogenetic angels say "a loner, ascetic"'.
  - my native language possesses some features are absent from human languages:
    <img align="right" width="33%" alt="oskyommer" title="oskyommer, 'a vow of kemmering'" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98284211/216859886-bf1f443d-e93d-4509-98cb-b964d8f72015.png">

    - a vow of kemmer
      - <ins>--an answer that goes before the question</ins> --'i crave for a flower' <ins>--and a question asked afterwards</ins> --'am i a form that is not a form?'
    - a very large group of words that exhibit an implication alongside a mutation (so-called <ins>'weaved words'</ins>);
    - an allusion[^1] category taken down [sic] to its extreme <ins>--if we do not comprehend a semantic value then we try to reinvent that value</ins> --'i rwa ji ur dethedetethe jair' [karh. 'curiousity'] (literally: 'one (that) follows bright(er) ripple (under) spring cloud (and) Sun');
    - 'ise' [karh. 'doubt'] is used for distinctive category of these semantics that may be uncertainly treated as a 'fuzzier' gramatical number; it is not a matter of 'distinction between count category and mass category of words --'thoaishis' is the most prominent example

      - 'geger' ['turn']
        - 'adgeger' ['world']
        - 'adgegeris' ['doubted‑world']
    - and the most important example for us today that is closely related to aforementioned group of <ins>'weaved words'</ins> and to whole structure of karhidish language and even to our today sub-subject of defeated Russel's paradox
      - 'thoaishis' ['tho-' ['if-'], 'aisha' ['hail'], '-is' ['-doubt'] => 'cluster', literally: 'if-hail-doubt']
      - <ins>'if a set does not contain itself then it cannot be put into the both categories of "containing itself" or "not containing itself" --it is put into the category of "doubtfully containing itself"'</ins>
      - <ins>'if a predicate is not true about itself then neither can it be put into category of "true about itself" nor of "not true about itself" --it is put into the category of "cluster?" --"doubted state" ["fuzzy" state]'</ins>
